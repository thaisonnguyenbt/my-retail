These days, the one-board answer to all terrain celebrates its 20-year reign with a proven formula that combines time-honored design and envelope-pushing ingredients for a lightweight, poppy, and stable snowboard that were unheard of two decades ago.&lt;br>&lt;/p>"

        reviews="&#xa;By NE2WA&#xa;from Edmonds, WA&#xa;&#xa;This watch/gps/heart rate monitor is a data crunching gem. With the free online connection, you can actually watch a graphical display of your swim/run on a map with associated changes in your heart rate, pace and step rate (with the foot chip). It takes a little time to set up, but is simple to use once you get started. I am loving this device and the feedback it's giving me."
